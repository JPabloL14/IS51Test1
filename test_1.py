The program is trying to determine which payment option is better (more money).
First option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days. The second option is 1 dollar 
a day with it being doubled each day for 10 days. There will be two functions to calculate the pay
rate. Function1 will calculate the amount for the first option, function2 will calculate the amount 
for the second option. 

Function1 will output 100 * 10 days. 
Function2 will loop 10 times with each time, doubling the amount and add the amount to the total. 

if the amount is equal, we output to the user "option 1 and option 2 pays the same" 
if the option 1 is better we output to the user "option 1 is better" 
if the option 2 is better, we output to the user "option 2 is better"
